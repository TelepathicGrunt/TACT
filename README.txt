Tiny Alex's Caves Tweaks

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves

----------------------------

Adjustments done:

- Added config option to change the stun duration of Primitive Club.

- Added config options to change health and attack damage for nearly all Alex's Caves mobs.

- Added Bass note block instrument to Pewen and Thornwood blocks so Every Compat mod can create variants of those wood types.

- Added config option to disable the End Story replacement that Alex's Caves replaced when beating Ender Dragon.

- Made Underweed, Tree Star, Fiddlehead, and Curly Fern be replaceable by blocks in your hand just like how vanilla grass and fern can be replaced by player block placing.

- Added all Alex's Cave biomes to `minecraft:is_overworld` tag for compatibility with other mods and datapacks.

- Added Forlorn Hollows, Magnetic Caves, Primordial Caves, and Toxic Caves to `forge:is_cave` for better mod compat.

- Added Primordial Caves to `forge:is_lush`.

- Added Ancient Sapling to `minecraft:saplings` block tag.

- Added Pewen Sapling, Thornwood Sapling, and Ancient Sapling to `minecraft:saplings` item tag.

- Added Tree Star, Fiddlehead, and Curly Fern to `minecraft:replaceable` tag so other mods know they can replace these blocks safely like they do for grass.
