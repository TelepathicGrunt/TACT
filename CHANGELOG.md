### **(V.1.0.1 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### End Story:
Added config to revert End Story back to normal when beating Minecraft. This undoes the story replacement that Alex's Caves does.
 This config is set to false by default but if set to true, the story is put back to normal.

#### Tags:
Removed and adjusted some tags as Alex's Caves mod now has updated to include many tags.

Moved this mod's own tag adjustments into an internal datapack. Tag adjustments now has a config to allow turning them all on or off.

#### Structures:
Removed internal NBT file datapack as Alex's Caves updated to include the files themselves.

#### Misc:
Adjusted jar name to include minecraft version for clarity for what the mod is for.
