----------------------------

Adjustments done:

- Added all Alex's Cave biomes to `minecraft:is_overworld` tag for compatibility with other mods and datapacks.

- Added Forlorn Hollows, Magnetic Caves, Primordial Caves, and Toxic Caves to `forge:is_cave` for better mod compat.

- Added Primordial Caves to `forge:is_lush`.

- Added Forlorn Hollows to `forge:is_spooky`.

- Added Magnetic Caves to `forge:is_sparse/overworld` to signal no vegetation spawns here.

- Added Toxic Caves to `forge:is_wasteland`.

- Added Ancient Sapling, Thornwood Sapling, and Pewen Sapling to `minecraft:saplings` tag.

- Added Bone Worms, Underweed, Tree Star, Fiddlehead, Curly Fern, Pewen Pines to `minecraft:replaceable` tag so other mods know they can replace these blocks safely like they do for grass.

- Added Underweed, Tree Star, Fiddlehead, Curly Fern, Pewen Pines to `minecraft:replaceable_by_trees` tag so trees can grow and not be blocked by these blocks.
