### **(V.1.1.6 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### Entities:
Removed Tremorzilla attack config and replaced it with 6 new config to control the attack damage to each of its attacks.
The original config was setting the attack attribute, but it turned out that Tremorzilla does not actually use the attack attribute at all.
Instead, I needed to modify the hardcoded damage for each of its attacks.
