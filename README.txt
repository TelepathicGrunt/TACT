Tiny Alex's Caves Tweaks

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves

----------------------------

Adjustments done:

- Added all Alex's Cave biomes to `minecraft:is_overworld` tag for compatibility with other mods and datapacks.

- Added all Alex's Cave biomes to `minecraft:mineshaft_blocking` tag as Alex seems to prefer large structures not to interfere with caves. So we will block Mineshafts.

- Added Forlorn Hollows, Magnetic Caves, Primordial Caves, and Toxic Caves to `forge:is_cave` for better mod compat.

- Added Primordial Caves to `forge:is_lush`.

- Added Forlorn Hollows to `forge:is_spooky`.

- Added Magnetic Caves to `forge:is_sparse/overworld` to signal no vegetation spawns here.

- Added Toxic Caves to `forge:is_wasteland`.
