https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alexs-caves

----------------------------

Adjustments done:

- Added config option to change the stun duration of Primitive Club.

- Added config to allow changing the speed of Nuclear Furnace smelting time.

- Added config option to adjust how many arrows Dreadbow will spawn per arrow type.

- Added config options to change health, armor, and attack damage for nearly all Alex's Caves mobs.

- Added configs to control the recharge and depletion rate of Subterranodon's flight meter.

- Added configs to control Raygun damaging rates when Gamma enchanted and not enchanted.

- Added config option to allow Cloak of Darkness to charge and use ability in bight light areas.

- Added config to allow making Guano, Guano Block, and Guano Layer be usable as Furnace fuel.

- Added config option to disable the End Story replacement that Alex's Caves replaced when beating Ender Dragon. (Not disabled by default)

- Added config option to unlock all pages in the Cave Compendium book on log in. (Config is off by default)

- Made Underweed, Tree Star, Fiddlehead, and Curly Fern be replaceable by blocks in your hand just like how vanilla grass and fern can be replaced by player block placing.

- Added Galena and Radrock to `minecraft:stone_crafting_materials` and to `minecraft:stone_tool_materials` item tags so these cobbled-looking stone can be more useful!

- Added all Alex's Cave biomes to `minecraft:is_overworld` tag for compatibility with other mods and datapacks.

- Added Forlorn Hollows, Magnetic Caves, Primordial Caves, and Toxic Caves to `forge:is_cave` for better mod compat.

- Added Primordial Caves to `forge:is_lush`.

- Added Tree Star, Fiddlehead, and Curly Fern to `minecraft:replaceable` tag so other mods know they can replace these blocks safely like they do for grass.
