### **(V.1.1.4 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### Entities:
Made Tremosaurus without riders have their bite shake attack now deal about half the Attack Damage attribute value.
 The attack Damage attribute is 14 damages by default. Tremorsaurus's bite shake attack deals 5-7 damage if not order by a rider on the mob.
 So to respect that original value, I have that attack be half the Attack Damage attribute value so the damage scales up the higher
 you make the Attack Damage attribute value for the mob.
